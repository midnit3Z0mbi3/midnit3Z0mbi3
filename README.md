**Definition of Open-Source Intelligence**

According to the U.S. government, open-source intelligence (OSINT) is defined as “intelligence that is
produced from publicly available information and is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely
manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement.”

🌱 I am always learning more about **OSINT**, Cybersecurity, and anything Linux.

💬 Ask me anything about **OSINT**.

🔭 I am currently working on <a href="https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/">Sophia Santos'</a> OSINT exercises.
